## Overview

Business Rules Management System (BRMS) solution for abstracting business logic (rules, policies) from the system.
It provides a simple way to separate your rules and your application core logic,
thus ensuring that any changes to the rules will not affect the main system.

This engine supports dynamic sandboxed expressions powered by https://github.com/twineworks/tweakflow
